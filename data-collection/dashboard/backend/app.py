"""FastAPI layer (T05) — wires the capture loop, dataset writer, and renderer
into the six endpoints of the spec's Runtime table.

The threading rules that bite (spec §Threading rules) are load-bearing here:

- ``/flag`` and ``/validate`` are plain ``def`` (not ``async``). Their blocking
  work (``cv2.imwrite`` + RLE encode; the in-process validator's disk walk) runs
  on Starlette's threadpool, off the event loop, so a SPACE press never freezes
  ``/stream``.
- ``/flag`` grabs the ``Latest`` tuple **reference** atomically via
  ``capture.snapshot()`` (the loop rebinds it under its own lock, never mutates in
  place), then does its blocking work on that stable snapshot.
- ``/flag`` and the dataset-mutating half of ``/settings`` serialize on a single
  ``dataset_lock`` so rapid concurrent flags get sequential ``image_id``/``ann_id``
  and never a torn ``annotations.json``.
- Provenance uses the threshold captured **into the snapshot at predict time**
  (``snap.threshold``), never the live slider value at flag time.
- ``/stream`` paces on ``capture.generation`` so each overlay is sent exactly once.
